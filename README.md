An interactive and visually appealing digital clock with a modern design and customizable features, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time, date, and offers features like a theme toggle, time zone selection, and an hourly chime.

## Features

- **Date Display**: Shows the current date in a user-friendly format, including the day of the week, month, day, and year.
- **Timezone Selection**: Easily switch between different time zones from a dropdown menu.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between a dark and light theme to customize the appearance.
- **Animated Background**: A gradient background that smoothly shifts colors for a dynamic and engaging look.
- **Hourly Chime**: An optional sound that plays every hour on the hour.
